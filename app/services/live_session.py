"""Live voice check-ins with GPT-Live (spec docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-12-live-voice-2a-design.md, A2 and A3).

The robot opens the WebSocket /api/device/conversations/live on the device port (api_device.conversation_live), and
one LiveRelay runs the chat on it. JSON text frames carry the messages; binary frames carry audio, PCM16 mono at
16 kHz, both ways.
- robot -> server: {"type": "start", "task_id", "language", "rate": 16000, "bridge_version"} first; later
  {"type": "end", "reason"}, {"type": "playing"} and {"type": "idle"}.
- server -> robot: {"type": "ready", "conversation_id"}, {"type": "flush"}, {"type": "say", "speech_text", "reason"},
  {"type": "fallback", "reason", "conversation_id"} and {"type": "end", "reason", "risk"}.

The start: after `start` the server checks, in this order, and answers `fallback` (conversation_id null; then it
closes the socket) at the first failure, before any conversation row exists: LIVE_VOICE_TEST (live_disabled), the
rate (unsupported_rate), check-in consent (checkin_consent_required), the task this robot leased (task_not_found), the
robot's live switch on the Reachy card (live_disabled), a usable live model on the AI connections card
(live_not_configured). Then GPT-Live must start within CONNECT_TIMEOUT, else live_unavailable. Only then is the
conversation row written (mode 'live', the live model's id), with Reachy's opening as its first turn; the robot gets
`ready`, and GPT-Live says the opening in its own voice. A robot that gets a fallback starts today's text chat with
POST /conversations. A first message that is not a valid start closes the socket with BAD_START.
