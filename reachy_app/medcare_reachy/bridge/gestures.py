"""Reachy's body language in a check-in conversation: it visibly thinks while a reply is being prepared, and its
antennas stay lively while it speaks.

One thread streams targets: small offsets from the neutral pose, at GESTURE_HZ (MOVE_HZ while a recorded move plays).
Every motion fades in and out over FADE_SECONDS, so one motion flows into the next and the robot comes back to the
neutral pose without a jump (the servos have no speed limit of their own: the daemon sends each target straight to
them). Each offset is clamped to LIMITS whatever the mix, or to MOVE_LIMITS while the recorded move plays.

Thinking starts with Pollen's recorded "inquiring3" move (moves.py: played as offsets from its first frame, without
its sound), then flows from its last frame into a slow sway until Reachy speaks. It plays at most once every
MOVE_AGAIN_SECONDS. Cut short (Reachy starts speaking, or the patient goes on talking), it fades out over
MOVE_FADE_SECONDS and slows down as it does (it plays at the square of its fade level's speed), so a cut at any
moment moves no part faster than the recording itself does. (A plain 0.5 s fade, cut while the move lowers its
antenna at the recording's 280°/s, made 430°/s.) Speaking moves the antennas only.

A stream's first target is where the robot is, so a stream only starts from where it knows the robot is: after a
goto put it in the neutral pose (`placed()`), and only if it is measured there or close to it (`start_from()`).
Measured near the neutral pose, the first target is that pose itself; a little further (the head sank a few degrees),
the first target is the pose measured, and the stream eases back to the neutral pose over RECENTER_SECONDS, under the
motion. A goto elsewhere (`halt()` must come first: while a goto runs, the daemon ignores every target), a stream
that ended early (motors off, the daemon gone) and a robot measured far from that pose (the motors switched off and
on while it was still, a hand holding the head) all stop motion until the next `placed()`.
