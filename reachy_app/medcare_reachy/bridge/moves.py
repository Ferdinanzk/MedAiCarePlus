"""Pollen's recorded emotion moves (the Reachy Mini Emotions Library), played inside Reachy's own gesture stream.

Reachy thinks with "inquiring3" ("A fast movement that lets you ask a question", 2.92 s at 50 Hz), kept in moves/
(see NOTICE there) so that it works offline whatever the robot's Hugging Face cache holds. Its sound is not kept.

The SDK's way of playing a move doesn't fit a conversation: play_move() blocks for the whole move, jumps to the
move's first frame (inquiring3's is not the neutral pose: the head 3.6° and 12 mm off, the body 6.9°, the left
antenna 20°) and plays the move's sound; cancel_move() also stops the app's audio output, which carries Reachy's
speech; the daemon's recorded-move route always plays the sound and ignores other targets while it runs. Here a move
is data only: its offsets from its first frame, which gestures.py adds to the neutral pose like its other motions,
so it starts from where the robot is, fades out the moment Reachy speaks, and never touches the audio.
