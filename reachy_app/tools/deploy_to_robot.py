"""Copy this working copy's medcare_reachy package onto the robot and switch it to server-side vision.

Interim deployment until the Hugging Face space is updated: reinstalling the app from the dashboard puts the
space's version back. The installed package is backed up first (~/.medcare_reachy/backup-<time>.tgz).

    python tools/deploy_to_robot.py [--host reachy-mini.local] [--user pollen] [--camera-ipc-fps 15]

The SSH password comes from REACHY_SSH_PASSWORD, or is asked for.

Voice clips: every zh-TW clip whose WAV is missing on the robot, or was rendered from other words than the
manifest has now, is rendered again with Matcha-TTS on the robot (~/.medcare_reachy/clips/zh-TW/rendered.json
records what each WAV says). The deploy stops when a planned clip was not written, and when any manifest clip has no
WAV on the robot afterwards; a clip SenseVoice does not hear exactly as written is kept with a warning to listen to
it. The check-in's 「嗯」 (ack) and thinking phrases (manifest "variants") are kept only when SenseVoice hears them as
words the app recognises as its own echo; otherwise they are not written and the deploy fails.

Camera: Reachy Mini's daemon (reachy_mini 1.11) shares the camera with apps at IPC_FPS = 10 frames per second,
below the 12 fps the server needs to record a dose. --camera-ipc-fps 15 edits that constant in the daemon (a
backup is kept next to it); it takes effect when the daemon restarts, which this script never does.
